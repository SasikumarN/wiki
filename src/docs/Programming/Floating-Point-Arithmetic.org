* The problem of the Floating-Point
For example, the real number ‘.37’ cannot be represented exactly by
the arithmetic series described above so, if you assign this number to
a floating point, the value stored could actually be ‘0.370000004’.
This can be seen easily if we write a simple program that prints a
floating point value to a lot of decimal places.

#+begin_src c
// some code to print a floating point number to a lot of 
// decimal places
int main()
{
    float f = .37;
    printf("%.20f\n", f);
}
#+end_src

** Floating-point Formats
Several different representations of real numbers have been proposed,
but by far the most widely used is the floating-point
representation.[fn:1]Floating-point representations have a base \beta
(which is always assumed to be even) and a precision /p/.  If \beta  = 2 and
/p/ = 24, then the decimal number 0.1 cannot be represented exactly, but
is approximately 1.10011001100110011001101 × 2-4.


In general, a floating-point number will be represented as ± d.dd... d
×\beta^e, where d.dd...d is called the *significand* and has /p/ digits. More
precisely ±d_0.d_1 d_2 ... d_{p-1} ×\beta^e represents the number

\pm (d_0+d_{1}\beta^{-1}+...+d_{p-1}\beta^{-(p-1)})\beta^e, (0< d_i <\beta)

[fn:1] Examples of other representations are floating slash and signed
  logarithm [Matula and Kornerup 1985; Swartzlander and Alexopoulos
  1975].
