* Pragmatic Software Development Tips
+ *Care About Your Craft*
  
  Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing
  it well?
+ *Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses*

  Instead of excuses, provide options. Don’t say it can’t be done;
  explain what can be done.
+ *Be a Catalyst for Change*

  You can’t force change on people. Instead, show them how the future
  might be and help them participate in creating it.
