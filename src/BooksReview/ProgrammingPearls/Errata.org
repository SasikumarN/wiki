The second printing had no changes from the first printing.

The following bugs need to be fixed in upcoming printings.

p. 38, line 23. The clause cantbe(m, n) should be cantbe(m, n-1).

p. 121, line 11: The inequality sign is reversed; the test should read “if u-l < cutoff”. (The test is correct in the function qsort4 later on the page.)

p. 129, line -14: The variables “m” and “n” are swapped. The sentence should read: “Next, suppose that m is ten million and n is 231.”

p. 203, line 12: Change “commutative” to “associative”.

p. 224, line -2: Remove the phrase “or print n + 1 – i rather than i”.

p. 241, line -13: Insert “p” after “*”, so the line reads

unsigned int hash(char *p)
