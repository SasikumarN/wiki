#+OPTIONS: num:nil H:2



* Import Conventions
The Python community has adopted a number of naming conventions for commonly-
used modules:
#+begin_src python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#+end_src

* pandas
The pandas name itself is derived from panel data, an econometrics
term for multidi- mensional structured data sets, and Python data
analysis itself.
