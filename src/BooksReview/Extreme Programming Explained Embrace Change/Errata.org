Errata from KentBeckâ€˜s book ExtremeProgrammingExplainedEmbraceChange:

Page 89 Baroque StoryCard formats like the one illustrated at the bottom of the page are deprecated in favor of ordinary blank lined notecards.

Page 92 Baroque TaskCard formats are likewise deprecated. (Some groups eschew task cards entirely, in favor of lists on marker or easel boards.)

Page 93 LoadFactor (ideal time divided by calendar time) is deprecated in favor of the simpler concept of Velocity (work units per iteration; see ProjectVelocity).

Page 108 In figures 11 and 12, the UML inheritance triangles are pointing the wrong direction.
