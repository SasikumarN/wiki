* Chapter 1
To be an appropriate candidate for recursive solution, a problem must
have three distinct properties:


+ It must be possible to decompose the original problem into simpler instances of the same problem.
+ Once each of these simpler subproblems has been solved, it must be possible to combine these solutions to produce a solution to the original problem.
+ As the large problem is broken down into successively less complex
  ones, those subproblems must eventually become so simple that they
  can be solved without further subdivision.
