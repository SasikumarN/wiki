#+OPTIONS: num:nil H:2


* Doxygen Download Page
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/download.html

* Compiling from source on UNIX
** Unpack the archive, unless you already have done that:
#+begin_src sh
gunzip doxygen-$VERSION.src.tar.gz    # uncompress the archive
tar xf doxygen-$VERSION.src.tar       # unpack it
#+end_src
** Run the configure script:
#+begin_src sh
sh ./configure
#+end_src
The script tries to determine the platform you use, the make tool
(which must be GNU make) and the perl interpreter. It will report what
it finds.

To override the auto detected platform and compiler you can run
configure as follows:
#+begin_src sh
configure --platform platform-type
#+end_src
See the PLATFORMS file for a list of possible platform options.

If you have Qt-4.3 or higher installed and want to build the GUI
front-end, you should run the configure script with the
â€“with-doxywizard option:
#+begin_src sh
configure --with-doxywizard
#+end_src
For an overview of other configuration options use
#+begin_src sh
configure --help
#+end_src
** Compile the program by running make:
#+begin_src sh
make
#+end_src
The program should compile without problems and the binaries (doxygen
and optionally doxywizard) should be available in the bin directory of
the distribution.

** Optional: Generate the user manual.
#+begin_src sh
make docs
#+end_src
To let doxygen generate the HTML documentation.

The HTML directory of the distribution will now contain the html
documentation (just point a HTML browser to the file index.html in the
html directory). You will need the python interpreter for this.

** Optional: Generate a PDF version of the manual (you will need pdflatex, makeindex, and egrep for this).
#+begin_src sh
make pdf
#+end_src
The PDF manual doxygen_manual.pdf will be located in the latex
directory of the distribution. Just view and print it via the acrobat
reader.



** install
make install

* Tools used to develop doxygen
Doxygen was developed and tested under Linux & MacOSX using the following open-source tools:

+ GCC version 3.3.6 (Linux) and 4.0.1 (MacOSX)
+ GNU flex version 2.5.33 (Linux) and 2.5.4 (MacOSX)
+ GNU bison version 1.75
+ GNU make version 3.80
+ Perl version 5.8.1
+ VIM version 6.2
+ Firefox 1.5
+ Trolltech's tmake version 1.3 (included in the distribution)
+ teTeX version 2.0.2
+ CVS 1.12.12

* LaTex and Ghostscript
LaTex:

+ MikTex: http://www.miktex.org/
+ XemTex: http://www.xemtex.org/

Ghostscript:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/ghostscript/

* Getting started 
** Step 1: Creating a configuration file
doxygen -g <config-file>

If you use - (i.e. the minus sign) as the file name then doxygen will try to read the configuration file from standard input (stdin), which can be useful for scripting.

** Step 2: Running doxygen
To generate the documentation you can now enter: 

doxygen <config-file>

** Step 3: Documenting the sources
1. Place a special documentation block in front of the declaration or
   definition of the member, class or namespace. For file, class and
   namespace members it is also allowed to place the documentation
   directly after the member.

   See section Special comment blocks to learn more about special
   documentation blocks.

2. Place a special documentation block somewhere else (another file or
   another location) and put a structural command in the documentation
   block. A structural command links a documentation block to a
   certain entity that can be documented (e.g. a member, class,
   namespace or file).

   See section Documentation at other places to learn more about
   structural commands.


During parsing the following steps take place:

+ Markdown formatting is replaced by corresponding HTML or special commands.
+ The special commands inside the documentation are executed. See
  section Special Commands for an overview of all commands.
+ If a line starts with some whitespace followed by one or more
  asterisks (*) and then optionally more whitespace, then all
  whitespace and asterisks are removed.
+ All resulting blank lines are treated as a paragraph separators.
  This saves you from placing new-paragraph commands yourself in order
  to make the generated documentation readable.
+ Links are created for words corresponding to documented classes
  (unless the word is preceded by a %; then the word will not be
  linked and the % sign is removed).
+ Links to members are created when certain patterns are found in the
  text. See section Automatic link generation for more information on
  how the automatic link generation works.
+ HTML tags that are in the documentation are interpreted and
  converted to  equivalents for the  output. See section HTML Commands
  for an overview of all supported HTML tags.


* Documenting the code 
** Comment blocks for C-like languages (C/C++/C#/Objective-C/PHP/Java)
*** There are several ways to mark a comment block as a detailed description: 

**** 1.You can use the JavaDoc style, which consist of a C-style comment block starting with two *'s, like this:
#+begin_src sh
/**
 * ... text ...
 */
#+end_src
**** 2.or you can use the Qt style and add an exclamation mark (!) after the opening of a C-style comment block, as shown in this example:
#+begin_src sh
/*!
 * ... text ...
 */
#+end_src
In both cases the intermediate *'s are optional, so
#+begin_src sh
/*!
 ... text ...
*/
#+end_src
is also valid.


**** 3.A third alternative is to use a block of at least two C++ comment lines, where each line starts with an additional slash or an exclamation mark. Here are examples of the two cases:
#+begin_src sh
///
/// ... text ...
///
#+end_src
or
#+begin_src sh
//!
//!... text ...
//!
#+end_src
Note that a blank line ends a documentation block in this case.


**** 4. Some people like to make their comment blocks more visible 
in the documentation. For this purpose you can use the following:
#+begin_src sh
/********************************************//**
 *  ... text
 ***********************************************/
(note the 2 slashes to end the normal comment block and start a special comment block).
#+end_src
or
#+begin_src sh
/////////////////////////////////////////////////
/// ... text ...
/////////////////////////////////////////////////
#+end_src

*** For the brief description there are also several possibilities: 
**** 1.One could use the \brief 
command with one of the above comment blocks. This command ends at the
end of a paragraph, so the detailed description follows after an empty
line.

Here is an example:
#+begin_src sh
/*! \brief Brief description.
 *         Brief description continued.
 *
 *  Detailed description starts here.
 */
#+end_src
**** 2.If JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF is set to YES 
in the configuration file, then using JavaDoc style comment blocks
will automatically start a brief description which ends at the first
dot followed by a space or new line. Here is an example:

#+begin_src sh
/** Brief description which ends at this dot. Details follow
 *  here.
 */
#+end_src
The option has the same effect for multi-line special C++ comments: 
#+begin_src sh
/// Brief description which ends at this dot. Details follow
/// here.
#+end_src
**** 3.A third option is to use a special C++ style comment 
which does not span more than one line. Here are two examples: 
#+begin_src sh
/// Brief description.
/** Detailed description. */
#+end_src
or
#+begin_src sh
//! Brief description.

//! Detailed description 
//! starts here.
#+end_src
Note the blank line in the last example, which is required to separate
the brief description from the block containing the detailed
description. The JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF should also be set to NO for this
case.


As you can see doxygen is quite flexible. If you have multiple detailed descriptions, like in the following example:
#+begin_src sh
//! Brief description, which is
//! really a detailed description since it spans multiple lines.
/*! Another detailed description!
 */
#+end_src

*** Putting documentation after members
    If you want to document the members of a file, struct, union, class,
or enum, it is sometimes desired to place the documentation block
after the member instead of before. For this purpose you have to put
an additional < marker in the comment block. Note that this also works
for the parameters of a function.

Here are some examples: 
#+begin_src sh
int var; /*!< Detailed description after the member */
#+end_src
This block can be used to put a Qt style detailed documentation block after a member. Other ways to do the same are: 
#+begin_src sh
int var; /**< Detailed description after the member */
#+end_src
or 
#+begin_src sh
int var; //!< Detailed description after the member
         //!< 
#+end_src
or 
#+begin_src sh
int var; ///< Detailed description after the member
         ///< 
#+end_src
Most often one only wants to put a brief description after a member.
This is done as follows: 
#+begin_src sh
int var; //!< Brief description after the member
#+end_src
or 
#+begin_src sh
int var; ///< Brief description after the member
#+end_src
For functions one can use the @param command to document the parameters and then use [in], [out], [in,out] to document the direction. For inline documentation this is also possible by starting with the direction attribute, e.g. 
#+begin_src sh
void foo(int v /**< [in] docs for input parameter v. */);
#+end_src
*** Examples
**** Here is an example of a documented piece of C++ code using the Qt style: 
#+begin_src c
  
  //!  A test class. 
  /*!  
  A more elaborate class description.
  ,*/
  class Test
  {  
   public:
    //! An enum.
    /*! More detailed enum description. */
    enum TEnum {
      TVal1, /*!< Enum value TVal1. */
      TVal2, /*!< Enum value TVal2. */
      TVal3  /*!< Enum value TVal3. */
    }
    //! Enum pointer.
    /*! Details. */
    *enumPtr,
      //! Enum variable.
      /*! Details. */
      enumVar;
  
    //! A constructor.
    /*!      A more elaborate description of the constructor.    */
    Test();
    //! A destructor.
    /*!
      A more elaborate description of the destructor.
    */
    ~Test();
  
    //! A normal member taking two arguments and returning an integer value.
    /*!
      \param a an integer argument.
      \param s a constant character pointer.
      \return The test results
      \sa Test(), ~Test(), testMeToo() and publicVar()
    */
    int testMe(int a,const char *s);
    //! A pure virtual member.
    /*!
      \sa testMe()
      \param c1 the first argument.
      \param c2 the second argument.
    */
    virtual void testMeToo(char c1,char c2) = 0;
    //! A public variable.
    /*!
      Details.
    */
    int publicVar;
    //! A function variable.
    /*!
      Details.
    */
    int (*handler)(int a,int b);
  };
#+end_src
**** using JAVADOC style
This is not according the JavaDoc specification however, where the
first sentence of the documentation block is automatically treated as
a brief description. To enable this behavior you should set
JAVADOC_AUTOBRIEF to YES in the configuration file. If you enable this
option and want to put a dot in the middle of a sentence without
ending it, you should put a backslash and a space after it. Here is an
example: 

#+begin_src c
  /** Brief description (e.g.\ using only a few words). Details follow. */
#+end_src

#+begin_src c
  /**
   *  A test class. A more elaborate class description.
   */
  class Test
  {
   public:
    /**
     * An enum.
     * More detailed enum description.
     */
    enum TEnum {
      TVal1, /**< enum value TVal1. */
      TVal2, /**< enum value TVal2. */
      TVal3  /**< enum value TVal3. */
    }
    *enumPtr, /**< enum pointer. Details. */
      enumVar;  /**< enum variable. Details. */
    
    /**
     * A constructor.
     * A more elaborate description of the constructor.
     */
    Test();
    /**
     * A destructor.
     * A more elaborate description of the destructor.
     */
    ~Test();
  
    /**
     *a normal member taking two arguments and returning an integer value.
     * @param a an integer argument.
     * @param s a constant character pointer.
     * @see Test()
     * @see ~Test()
     * @see testMeToo()
     * @see publicVar()
     * @return The test results
     */
    int testMe(int a,const char *s);
    /**
     * A pure virtual member.
     * @see testMe()
     * @param c1 the first argument.
     * @param c2 the second argument.
     */
    virtual void testMeToo(char c1,char c2) = 0;
    /**
     * a public variable.
     * Details.
     */
    int publicVar;
    /**
     * a function variable.
     * Details.
     */
    int (*handler)(int a,int b);};

** Comment blocks in Python
*** For Python there is a standard way of documenting the code using so called documentation strings.
Note that in this case none of doxygen's special commands are supported.
#+begin_src python
  """@package docstring
       Documentation for this module.
       
       More details.
       """
       
       def func():
           """Documentation for a function.
       
          More details.
          """
          pass
      
      class PyClass:
          """Documentation for a class.
      
          More details.
          """
         
          def __init__(self):
              """The constructor."""
              self._memVar = 0;
         
          def PyMethod(self):
              """Documentation for a method."""
             pass
#+end_src

*** using doxygen style comments
There is also another way to document Python code using comments that
start with "##". These type of comment blocks are more in line with
the way documentation blocks work for the other languages supported by
doxygen and this also allows the use of special commands.

#+begin_src python
    ## @package pyexample
    #  Documentation for this module.
    #
    #  More details.
    
    ## Documentation for a function.
    #
    #  More details.
    def func():
       pass
   
   ## Documentation for a class.
   #
   #  More details.
   class PyClass:
      
       ## The constructor.
       def __init__(self):
           self._memVar = 0;
      
       ## Documentation for a method.
       #  @param self The object pointer.
       def PyMethod(self):
           pass
        
       ## A class variable.
       classVar = 0;
   
       ## @var _memVar
       #  a member variable
#+end_src

** Anatomy of a comment block
For this doxygen supports the Markdown syntax, including parts of the Markdown Extra extension.
