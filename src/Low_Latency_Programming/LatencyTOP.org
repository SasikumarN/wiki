#+OPTIONS: num:nil H:2

* Overview
LatencyTOP is a tool that lets you identify where in the system
latency is happening, and what kind of operation/action is causing the
latency to happen.

* Example uses in Ubuntu[fn:1]
** Preliminary check
LatencyTOP needs a kernel that was built with
=CONFIG_HAVE_LATENCYTOP_SUPPORT=y= and =CONFIG_LATENCYTOP=y= which is the
case for the standard newer Ubuntu kernels.

#+begin_src sh
# grep -i latencytop /boot/config-`uname -r`
CONFIG_HAVE_LATENCYTOP_SUPPORT=y
CONFIG_LATENCYTOP=y
#+end_src
** Installing LatencyTOP
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt-get install latencytop
#+end_src
** Usage
#+begin_src sh
sudo latencytop
#+end_src
