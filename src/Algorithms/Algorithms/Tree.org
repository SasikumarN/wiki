* Maximum Path Sum in a Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum. The path may start and
end at any node in the tree.

For each node there can be four ways that the max path goes through the node:
1. Node only
2. Max path through Left Child + Node
3. Max path through Right Child + Node
4. Max path through Left Child + Node + Max path through Right Child
