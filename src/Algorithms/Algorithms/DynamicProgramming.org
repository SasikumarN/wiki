* Overview[fn:1]
dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by
breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable to
problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and
optimal substructure

* Egg Dropping Puzzle[fn:2]
When we drop an egg from a floor x, there can be two cases (1) The egg
breaks (2) The egg doesn’t break.

1) If the egg breaks after dropping from xth floor, then we only need
   to check for floors lower than x with remaining eggs; so the
   problem reduces to x-1 floors and n-1 eggs

2) If the egg doesn’t break after dropping from the xth floor, then
   we only need to check for floors higher than x; so the problem
   reduces to k-x floors and n eggs.

Since we need to minimize the number of trials in worst case, we take
the maximum of two cases. We consider the max of above two cases for
every floor and choose the floor which yields minimum number of
trials.

#+begin_src sh
 k ==> Number of floors
  n ==> Number of Eggs
  eggDrop(n, k) ==> Minimum number of trails needed to find the critical
                    floor in worst case.
  eggDrop(n, k) = 1 + min{max(eggDrop(n - 1, x - 1), eggDrop(n, k - x)): 
                 x in {1, 2, ..., k}}

#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

int max(int a, int b) {return (a > b)? a : b;}

int eggDrop(int n, int k)
{
  /* store the minimum number of trials needed for i eggs and j floors */
  int eggdrop[n+1][k+1];
  int res;
  int i, j, x;

  /* need j trails for 1 egg and j floors */
  for(j = 0; j <= k; ++j)
    eggdrop[1][j] = j;
  /* need 1 trails for i egg and 1 floor
     need 0 trials for i egg and 0 floor*/
  for(i = 0; i <= n; ++i){
    eggdrop[i][1] = 1;
    eggdrop[i][0] = 0;
  }

  for(i = 2; i <= n; ++i){
    for(j = 2; j <= k; ++j){
      eggdrop[i][j] = INT_MAX;
      for(x = 1; x <= j; ++x){
        int res = 1 + max(eggdrop[i][j - x], eggdrop[i - 1][x - 1]);
        if(res < eggdrop[i][j])
          eggdrop[i][j] = res;
      }
    }
  }
  return eggdrop[n][k];
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int n = 2, k = 36;
   printf ("\nMinimum number of trials in worst case with %d eggs and "
             "%d floors is %d \n", n, k, eggDrop(n, k));
   return 0;

* Longest Common Subsequence
LCS Problem Statement: Given two sequences, find the length of longest
subsequence present in both of them. A subsequence is a sequence that
appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.

* Longest Increasing Subsequence
The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length
of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements
of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. For example, the
length of LIS for {10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80} is 6 and LIS is
{10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.
