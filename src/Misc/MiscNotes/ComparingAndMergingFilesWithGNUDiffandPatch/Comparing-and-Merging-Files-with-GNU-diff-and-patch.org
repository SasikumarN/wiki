#+TITLE: Comparing and Merging Files with GNU diff and patch Notes
#+OPTIONS: num:nil H:2

* Overview
gnu diff was written by Paul Eggert, Mike Haertel, David Hayes,
Richard Stallman, and Len Tower. Wayne Davison designed and implemented
the unified output format. The basic algorithm is described in
“An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations”, Eugene W. Myers,
Algorithmica Vol. 1 No. 2, 1986, pp. 251–266; and in “A File Comparison
Program”, Webb Miller and Eugene W. Myers, Software—Practice
and Experience Vol. 15 No. 11, 1985, pp. 1025–1040. The algorithm was
independently discovered as described in “Algorithms for Approximate String Matching”, E. Ukkonen, Information and Control Vol. 64, 1985,
pp. 100–118.

* Chapter 1: What Comparison Means
** 1.1 Hunks
When comparing two files, diff finds sequences of lines common to
both files, interspersed with groups of differing lines called
/hunks/.

** 1.2 Suppressing Differences in Blank and Tab Spacing
The ‘-E’ and ‘--ignore-tab-expansion’ options ignore the distinction
between tabs and spaces on input. A tab is considered to be equivalent
to the number of spaces to the next tab stop. diff assumes that tab
stops are set every 8 print columns.

The ‘-b’ and ‘--ignore-space-change’ options are stronger. They
ignore white space at line end, and consider all other sequences of one or
more white space characters to be equivalent.

=diff= considers the following two lines to be equivalent, where ‘$’
denotes the line end:
#+begin_verse
Here lyeth muche rychnesse in lytell space. -- John Heywood$
Here lyeth muche rychnesse in lytell space. -- John Heywood $
#+end_verse

The ‘-w’ and ‘--ignore-all-space’ options are stronger still. They
ignore difference even if one line has white space where the other line has
none.

=diff= considers the following two lines to be equivalent, where ‘$’ denotes the line end and ‘^M’
denotes a carriage return:
#+begin_verse
Here lyeth muche rychnesse in lytell space.-- John Heywood$
 He relyeth much erychnes seinly tells pace. --John Heywood ^M$
#+end_verse








** 1.3 Suppressing Differences in Blank Lines
The ‘-B’ and ‘--ignore-blank-lines’ options ignore insertions or
deletions of blank lines. These options affect only lines that are completely
empty; they do not affect lines that look empty but contain space or tab
characters.
** 1.4 Suppressing Case Differences
To request this, use the ‘-i’ or ‘--ignore-case’ option.
** 1.5 Suppressing Lines Matching a Regular Expression
To ignore insertions and deletions of lines that match a grep-style regular
expression, use the ‘-I regexp’ or ‘--ignore-matching-lines=regexp’
option. For example, ‘diff -I ’^[[:digit:]]’’ ignores all changes to lines
beginning with a digit.

You can specify more than one regular expression for lines to ignore
by using more than one ‘-I’ option. diff tries to match each line against
each regular expression.
** 1.6 Summarizing Which Files Differ
diff simply reports whether files differ. The ‘-q’ and ‘--brief’
options select this output format.

Unlike diff, cmp cannot compare directories; it can only compare two
files.
** 1.7 Binary Files and Forcing Text Comparisons
You can force diff to consider all files to be text files, and compare them
line by line, by using the ‘-a’ or ‘--text’ option.

You can also force diff to consider all files to be binary files, and
report only whether they differ (but not how). Use the ‘-q’ or ‘--brief’
option for this.

Use the ‘--binary’ option to force diff to read and write binary data
instead.

The ‘--strip-trailing-cr’ causes diff to treat input lines that end
in carriage return followed by newline as if they end in plain newline












* Chapter 2: diff Output Formats
** 2.2.1 Detailed Description of Normal Format
All line numbers are the original line numbers in each file. The types
of change commands are:

+ *‘lar’*: Add the lines in range r of the second file after line l of the
  first file. For example, ‘8a12,15’ means append lines 12–15 of file 2
  after line 8 of file 1; or, if changing file 2 into file 1, delete lines 12–15 of file 2.
+ *‘fct’*: Replace the lines in range f of the first file with lines
  in range t of the second file. This is like a combined add and
  delete, but more compact. For example, ‘5,7c8,10’ means change lines
  5–7 of file 1 to read as lines 8–10 of file 2; or, if changing file
  2 into file 1, change lines 8–10 of file 2 to read as lines 5–7 of file 1.
+ *‘rdl’* Delete the lines in range r from the first file; line l is
  where they would have appeared in the second file had they not been
  deleted. For example, ‘5,7d3’ means delete lines 5–7 of file 1; or,
  if changing file 2 into file 1, append lines 5–7 of file 1 after
  line 3 of file 2.

** 2.3 Showing Differences in Their Context
you will
also want to see the parts of the files near the lines that differ, to help you
understand exactly what has changed. These nearby parts of the files are
called the /context/.

gnu diff provides two output formats that show context around the
differing lines: context format and unified format.

** 2.3.1 Context Format
To select this output format, use the ‘-C lines’, ‘--context[=lines]’,
or ‘-c’ option. The argument lines that some of these options take is
the number of lines of context to show.
*** 2.3.1.1 Detailed Description of Context Format
The lines that differ between the two files start with one of
the following indicator characters, followed by a space character:

+ ‘!’: A line that is part of a group of one or more lines that
  changed between the two files. There is a corresponding group of
  lines marked with ‘!’ in the part of this hunk for the other file.

+ ‘+’ An “inserted” line in the second file that corresponds to
  nothing in the first file. 

+ ‘-’ A “deleted” line in the first file that corresponds to nothing
  in the second file.

** 2.3.2 Unified Format
To select this
output format, use the ‘-U lines’, ‘--unified[=lines]’, or ‘-u’ option. The
argument lines is the number of lines of context to show.

*** 2.3.2.1 Detailed Description of Unified Format
Unified format hunks look like this:
#+begin_verse
@@ from-file-range to-file-range @@
line-from-either-file
line-from-either-file...
#+end_verse

The lines that actually differ between the two files have one of the
following indicator characters in the left print column:
+ ‘+’ A line was added here to the first file.
+ ‘-’ A line was removed here from the first file.
*** 2.3.2.2 An Example of Unified Format

#+end_SRC

** 2.3.3.1 Showing Lines That Match Regular Expressions
use the ‘-F regexp’ or ‘--show-function-line=regexp’ option.

Here are suggested regular expressions for some
common languages:
#+begin_src sh
‘^[[:alpha:]$_]’
   C, C++, Prolog
‘^(’   Lisp
‘^@node’    Texinfo
#+end_src

The ‘-F’ and ‘--show-function-line’ options find the nearest unchanged
line that precedes each hunk of differences and matches the given
regular expression.

** 2.3.3.2 Showing C Function Headings
To show in which functions differences occur for C and similar languages,
you can use the ‘-p’ or ‘--show-c-function’ option.

** 2.3.4 Showing Alternate File Names
Here are the first two lines of the output from ‘diff -C 2
--label=original --label=modified lao tzu’:
#+begin_src sh
  *** original
  --- modified
#+end_src

** 2.4 Showing Differences Side by Side
The gutter contains one of the following markers:
#+begin_verse
white space
The corresponding lines are in common. That is, either the
lines are identical, or the difference is ignored because of one
of the ‘--ignore’ options (see Section 1.2 [White Space],
page 6).

‘|’   The corresponding lines differ, and they are either both complete
or both incomplete.

‘<’ The files differ and only the first file contains the line.
‘>’ The files differ and only the second file contains the line.
‘(’ Only the first file contains the line, but the difference is
ignored.
‘)’ Only the second file contains the line, but the difference is
ignored.
‘\’ The corresponding lines differ, and only the first line is incomplete.
‘/’ The corresponding lines differ, and only the second line is
incomplete.
#+end_verse
*** 2.4.1 Controlling Side by Side Format
The ‘-y’ or ‘--side-by-side’ option selects side by side format.

You can set the width of the output with the ‘-W columns’
or ‘--width=columns’ option.

The ‘--left-column’ option prints only the left column of two common
lines. The ‘--suppress-common-lines’ option suppresses common
lines entirely

*** 2.4.2 An Example of Side by Side Format
Here is the output of the command =‘diff -y -W 65 lao tzu’=.

** 2.6 Merging Files with If-then-else
To merge two files, use diff with the ‘-D name’ or ‘--ifdef=name’
option. The argument name is the C preprocessor identifier to use in
the #ifdef and #ifndef directives.

* Chapter 3: Incomplete Lines
When an input file ends in a non-newline character, its last line is
called an incomplete line because its last character is not a newline. All
other lines are called full lines and end in a newline character. Incomplete
lines do not match full lines unless differences in white space are
ignored
* Chapter 4: Comparing Directories
if you use the ‘-s’ or ‘--report-identical-files’ option, it reports
pairs of identical files.

if you use the ‘-r’ or ‘--recursive’ option, it compares every
corresponding pair of files in the directory trees, as many levels deep as they go.

You can make diff act
as though the file existed but was empty in the other directory, so that it
outputs the entire contents of the file that actually exists. To do this, use the ‘-N’ or ‘--new-file’
option.

If the older directory contains one or more large files that are not
in the newer directory, you can make the patch smaller by using the
‘--unidirectional-new-file’ option instead of ‘-N’. This option is like
‘-N’ except that it only inserts the contents of files that appear in the
second directory but not the first

To ignore some files while comparing directories, use the ‘-x pattern’
or ‘--exclude=pattern’ option. This option ignores any files or subdirectories
whose base names match the shell pattern pattern.

If you need to give this option many times, you can instead put
the patterns in a file, one pattern per line, and use the ‘-X file’ or
‘--exclude-from=file’ option.

You can do
this by using the ‘-S file’ or ‘--starting-file=file’ option. This compares
only the file file and all alphabetically later files in the topmost
directory level.

With
the ‘--ignore-file-name-case’ option, diff ignores case differences
in file names, so that for example the contents of the file ‘Tao’ in one
directory are compared to the contents of the file ‘TAO’ in the other.
The ‘--no-ignore-file-name-case’ option cancels the effect of the
‘--ignore-file-name-case’ option, reverting to the default behavior.

* Chapter 5: Making diff Output Prettier
** 5.1 Preserving Tab Stop Alignment
The first way is to have diff convert all tabs into the correct number
of spaces before outputting them; select this method with the ‘-t’ or
‘--expand-tabs’ option.
** 5.2 Paginating diff Output
The ‘-l’ and ‘--paginate’ options do this by sending the diff
output through the pr program.
* Chapter 6: diff Performance Tradeoffs
When the files you are comparing are large and have small
groups of changes scattered throughout them, you can use the
‘--speed-large-files’ option to make a different modification to the
algorithm that diff uses.
* Chapter 7: Comparing Three Files
  Three-way hunks have
plain ‘====’ lines, and two-way hunks have ‘1’, ‘2’, or ‘3’ appended to
specify which of the three input files differ in that hunk.

ut with the ‘-T’ or ‘--initial-tab’ option,
diff3 uses a tab instead of two spaces;

Commands take the following forms:

‘file:la’ This hunk appears after line l of file file, and contains no
lines in that file. To edit this file to yield the other files,
one must append hunk lines taken from the other files. For
example, ‘1:11a’ means that the hunk follows line 11 in the
first file and contains no lines from that file.

‘file:rc’ This hunk contains the lines in the range r of file file. The
range r is a comma-separated pair of line numbers, or just
one number if the range is a singleton. To edit this file to
yield the other files, one must change the specified lines to be
the lines taken from the other files. For example, ‘2:11,13c’
means that the hunk contains lines 11 through 13 from the
second file.
* Chapter 8: Merging From a Common Ancestor
* Chapter 9: Interactive Merging with sdiff
* Chapter 10: Merging with patch
** 10.1 Selecting the patch Input Format
The output
formats listed here are the only ones that patch can understand.
‘-c’
‘--context’
context diff.

‘-e’
‘--ed’ ed script.

‘-n’
‘--normal’ normal diff.

‘-u’
‘--unified’
unified diff.

** 10.3.2 Applying Reversed Patches
Sometimes people run diff with the new file first instead of second.
This creates a diff that is “reversed”. To apply such patches, give patch
the ‘-R’ or ‘--reverse’ option.

** 10.7 Applying Patches in Other Directories
The ‘-d directory’ or ‘--directory=directory’ option to patch makes
directory directory the current directory for interpreting both file names
in the patch file, and file names given as arguments to other options

Sometimes the file names given in a patch contain leading directories,
but you keep your files in a directory different from the one given in the
patch. In those cases, you can use the =‘-pnumber’= or =‘--strip=number’=
option to set the file name strip count to number. The strip count tells
patch how many slashes, along with the directory names between them,
to strip from the front of file names. A sequence of one or more adjacent
slashes is counted as a single slash. By default, patch strips off all leading
directories, leaving just the base file names.

For example, suppose the file name in the patch file is
=‘/gnu/src/emacs/etc/NEWS’=. Using =‘-p0’= gives the entire file
name unmodified, =‘-p1’= gives =‘gnu/src/emacs/etc/NEWS’= (no leading
slash), =‘-p4’= gives =‘etc/NEWS’=, and not specifying =‘-p’= at all gives =‘NEWS’=.
* Chapter 11: Tips for Making and Using Patches
** 11.1 Tips for Patch Producers
To generate the patch, use the command ‘diff -Naur old new’ where
old and new identify the old and new directories. The names old and
new should not contain any slashes. The ‘-N’ option lets the patch create
and remove files; ‘-a’ lets the patch update non-text files; ‘-u’ generates
useful time stamps and enough context; and ‘-r’ lets the patch update
subdirectories. Here is an example command, using Bourne shell syntax:
#+begin_src sh
diff -Naur gcc-3.0.3 gcc-3.0.4
#+end_src
* Chapter 13: Invoking diff
** 13.1 Options to diff
Brackets
([ and ]) indicate that an option takes an optional argument.
#+begin_verse
‘-a’
‘--text’ Treat all files as text and compare them line-by-line, even
if they do not seem to be text. See Section 1.7 [Binary],
page 8.

‘-b’
‘--ignore-space-change’
Ignore changes in amount of white space. See Section 1.2
[White Space], page 6.

‘-B’
‘--ignore-blank-lines’
Ignore changes that just insert or delete blank lines. See
Section 1.3 [Blank Lines], page 7.
‘--binary’ Read and write data in binary mode. See Section

‘-c’ Use the context output format, showing three lines of context.
See Section 2.3.1 [Context Format], page 14.

‘-C lines’
‘--context[=lines]’
Use the context output format, showing lines (an integer)
lines of context, or three if lines is not given. See Section
2.3.1 [Context Format], page 14. For proper operation,
patch typically needs at least two lines of context.
On older systems, diff supports an obsolete option ‘-lines’
that has effect when combined with ‘-c’ or ‘-p’. posix
1003.1-2001 (see Chapter 17 [Standards conformance],
page 97) does not allow this; use ‘-C lines’ instead.

specifies the number of lines affected. See Section 2.5.3
[RCS], page 23.

‘-N’

the other. See Chapter 4 [Comparing Directories], page 35.

‘-U lines’
‘--unified[=lines]’
Use the unified output format, showing lines (an integer)
lines of context, or three if lines is not given. See Section
2.3.2 [Unified Format], page 16. For proper operation,
patch typically needs at least two lines of context.
On older systems, diff supports an obsolete option ‘-lines’
that has effect when combined with ‘-u’. posix 1003.1-2001
(see Chapter 17 [Standards conformance], page 97) does not
allow this; use ‘-U lines’ instead.

Output at most columns (default 130) print columns per
line in side by side format. See Section 2.4.1 [Side by Side
Format], page 20.

‘-x pattern’
‘--exclude=pattern’
When comparing directories, ignore files and subdirectories
whose basenames match pattern. See Chapter 4 [Comparing
Directories], page 35.

‘-X file’

** 15.1 Options to patch
Multiple single-letter options that do not take an argument can be
combined into a single command line argument with only one dash.
#+begin_verse
‘-b’
‘--backup’ Back up the original contents of each file, even if backups
would normally not be made. See Section 10.8 [Backups],
page 60.

‘-B prefix’
‘--prefix=prefix’
Prepend prefix to backup file names. See Section 10.9
[Backup Names], page 60.

‘--backup-if-mismatch’
Back up the original contents of each file if the patch does not
exactly match the file. This is the default behavior when not
conforming to posix. See Section 10.8 [Backups], page 60.

‘--binary’ Read and write all files in binary mode, except for standard
output and ‘/dev/tty’. This option has no effect on posixconforming
systems like gnu/Linux. On systems where this
option makes a difference, the patch should be generated by
‘diff -a --binary’. See Section 1.7 [Binary], page 8.

‘-c’
‘--context’
Interpret the patch file as a context diff. See Section 10.1
[patch Input], page 53.

‘-d directory’
‘--directory=directory’
Make directory directory the current directory for interpreting
both file names in the patch file, and file names given as
arguments to other options. See Section 10.7 [patch Directories],
page 59.

‘-D name’
‘--ifdef=name’
Make merged if-then-else output using name. See Section 2.6
[If-then-else], page 24.

‘--dry-run’
Print the results of applying the patches without actually
changing any files. See Section 10.3.4 [Dry Runs], page 56.

‘--ed’ Interpret the patch file as an ed script. See Section 10.1
[patch Input], page 53.

‘-E’
‘--remove-empty-files’
Remove output files that are empty after the patches have
been applied. See Section 10.4 [Creating and Removing],

** 2.6.1 Line Group Formats
You should quote format, because it typically contains shell
metacharacters.
‘--old-group-format=format’
These line groups are hunks containing only lines from the
first file. The default old group format is the same as the
changed group format if it is specified; otherwise it is a format
that outputs the line group as-is.

‘--new-group-format=format’
These line groups are hunks containing only lines from the
second file. The default new group format is same as the
changed group format if it is specified; otherwise it is a format
that outputs the line group as-is.

‘--changed-group-format=format’
These line groups are hunks containing lines from both files.
The default changed group format is the concatenation of
the old and new group formats.

‘--unchanged-group-format=format’
These line groups contain lines common to both files. The
default unchanged group format is a format that outputs the
line group as-is.

In a line group format, ordinary characters represent themselves; conversion
specifications start with ‘%’ and have one of the following forms.
‘%<’ stands for the lines from the first file, including the trailing
newline. Each line is formatted according to the old line
format (see Section 2.6.2 [Line Formats], page 27).
‘%>’ stands for the lines from the second file, including the trailing
newline. Each line is formatted according to the new line
format.
‘%=’ stands for the lines common to both files, including the trailing
newline. Each line is formatted according to the unchanged
line format.
‘%%’ stands for ‘%’.
‘%c’C’’ where C is a single character, stands for C. C may not be a
backslash or an apostrophe. For example, ‘%c’:’’ stands for
a colon, even inside the then-part of an if-then-else format,
which a colon would normally terminate.
‘%c’\O’’ where O is a string of 1, 2, or 3 octal digits, stands for the
character with octal code O. For example, ‘%c’\0’’ stands
for a null character.

‘Fn’ where F is a printf conversion specification and n is one of
the following letters, stands for n’s value formatted with F.
‘e’ The line number of the line just before the
group in the old file.
‘f’ The line number of the first line in the group
in the old file; equals e + 1.

‘l’ The line number of the last line in the group in
the old file.
‘m’ The line number of the line just after the group
in the old file; equals l + 1.
‘n’ The number of lines in the group in the old file;
equals l - f + 1.
‘E,F,L,M,N ’
Likewise, for lines in the new file.
