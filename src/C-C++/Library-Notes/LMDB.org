LMDB is a tiny database with some great capabilities:
+ Ordered-map interface (keys are always sorted, supports range lookups)
+ Fully transactional, full ACID semantics with MVCC.
+ Reader/writer transactions: readers don't block writers and writers
  don't block readers. Writers are fully serialized, so writes are
  always deadlock-free.
+ Read transactions are extremely cheap, and can be performed using no
  mallocs or any other blocking calls.
+ Supports multi-thread and multi-process concurrency, environments
  may be opened by multiple processes on the same host.
+ Multiple sub-databases may be created with transactions covering all
  sub-databases.
+ Memory-mapped, allowing for zero-copy lookup and iteration.
+ Maintenance-free, no external process or background
  cleanup/compaction required.
+ Crash-proof, no logs or crash recovery procedures required.
+ No application-level caching. LMDB fully exploits the operating
  system's buffer cache.
+ 32KB of object code and 6KLOC of C.
