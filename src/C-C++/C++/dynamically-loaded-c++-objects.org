* Overview
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_loading][Dynamic loading]] is a mechanism by which a computer program can, at run
time, load a library (or other binary) into memory, retrieve the
addresses of functions and variables contained in the library, execute
those functions or access those variables, and unload the library from
memory.
