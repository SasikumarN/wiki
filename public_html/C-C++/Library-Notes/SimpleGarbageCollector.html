<h2 id="sec-2">The Pros and Cons of Manual Memory Management</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
The main benefit of manually managing dynamic memory is efficiency.
Because there is no garbage collector, no time is spent keeping track
of active objects or periodically looking for unused memory. Instead,
when the programmer knows that the allocated object is no longer
needed, the programmer explicitly frees it and no additional overhead
is incurred. Because it has none of the overhead associated with
garbage collection, the manual approach enables more efficient code to
be written This is one reason why it was necessary for C++ to support
manual memory management: it enabled the creation of high-performance
code.
</p>

<p>
Another advantage to the manual approach is control. Although
requiring the programmer to handle both the allocation and release of
memory is a burden, the benefit is that the programmer gains complete
control over both halves of the process. You know precisely when
memory is being allocated and precisely when it is being released.
Furthermore, when you release an object via delete, its destructor is
executed at that point rather than at some later time, as can be the
case with garbage collection. Thus, with the manual method you can
control precisely when an allocated object is destroyed.
</p>

<p>
Although it is efficient, manual memory management is susceptible to a
rather annoying type of error: the memory leak. Because memory must be
freed manually, it is possible (even easy) to forget to do so. Failing
to release unused memory means that the memory will remain allocated
even if it is no longer needed. Memory leaks cannot occur in a garbage
collection environment because the garbage collector ensures that
unused objects are eventually freed. Memory leaks are a particularly
troublesome problem in Windows programming, where the failure to
release unused resources slowly degrades performance.
</p>

<p>
Other problems that can occur with C++’s manual approach include the
premature releasing of memory that is still in use, and the accidental
freeing of the same memory twice. Both of these errors can lead to
serious trouble. Unfortunately, they may not show any immediate
symptoms, making them hard to find.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">The Pros and Cons of Garbage Collection</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
There are several different ways to implement garbage collection, each
offering different performance characteristics. However, all garbage
collection systems share a set of common attributes that can be
compared against the manual approach. The main advantages to garbage
collection are simplicity and safety. In a garbage collection
environment, you explicitly allocate memory via new, but you never
explicitly free it. Instead, unused memory is automatically recycled.
Thus, it is not possible to forget to release an object or to release
an object prematurely. This simplifies programming and prevents an
entire class of problems. Furthermore, it is not possible to
accidentally free dynamically allocated memory twice. Thus, garbage
collection provides an easy-to-use, error-free, reliable solution to
the memory management problem.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the simplicity and safety of garbage collection come at
a price. The first cost is the overhead incurred by the garbage
collection mechanism. All garbage collection schemes consume some CPU
cycles because the reclamation of unused memory is not a cost-free
process. This overhead does not occur with the manual approach.
</p>

<p>
A second cost is loss of control over when an object is destroyed.
Unlike the manual approach, in which an object is destroyed (and its
destructor called) at a known point in time—when a delete statement is
executed on that object—garbage collection does not have such a hard
and fast rule. Instead, when garbage collection is used, an object is
not destroyed until the collector runs and recycles the object, which
may not occur until some arbitrary time in the future. For example,
the collector might not run until the amount of free memory drops
below a certain point. Furthermore, it is not always possible to know
the order in which objects will be destroyed by the garbage collector.
In some cases, the inability to know precisely when an object is
destroyed can cause trouble because it also means that your program
can’t know precisely when the destructor for a dynamically allocated
object is called.
</p>

<p>
For garbage collection systems that run as a background task, this
loss of control can escalate into a potentially more serious problem
for some types of applications because it introduces what is
essentially nondeterministic behavior into a program. A garbage
collector that executes in the background reclaims unused memory at
times that are, for all practical purposes, unknowable. For example,
the collector will usually run only when free CPU time is available.
Because this might vary from one program run to the next, from one
computer to next, or from one operating system to the next, the
precise point in program execution at which the garbage collector
executes is effectively nondeterministic. This is not a problem for
many programs, but it can cause havoc with real-time applications in
which the unexpected allocation of CPU cycles to the garbage collector
could cause an event to be missed.

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4">You Can Have It Both Ways</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
As the preceding discussions explained, both manual management and
garbage collection maximize one feature at the expense of another. The
manual approach maximizes efficiency and control at the expense of
safety and ease of use. Garbage collection maximizes simplicity and
safety but pays for it with a loss of runtime performance and control.
Thus, garbage collection and manual memory management are essentially
opposites, each maximizing the traits that the other sacrifices. This
is why neither approach to dynamic memory management can be optimal
for all programming situations.
</p>

<p>
Although opposites, the two approaches are not mutually exclusive.
They can coexist. Thus, it is possible for the C++ programmer to have
access to both approaches, choosing the proper method for the task at
hand.

<h2 id="sec-5">Creating a Garbage Collector in C++</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
A better solution is one in which the garbage collector can be used
with any type of dynamically allocated object. To provide such a
solution, the garbage collector must:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Coexist with the built-in, manual method provided by C++.
</li>
<li>Not break any preexisting code. Moreover, it must have no impact
whatsoever on existing code.
</li>
<li>Work transparently so that allocations that use garbage collection
are operated on in the same way as those that don’t.
</li>
<li>Allocate memory using new in the same way that C++’s built-in
approach does.
</li>
<li>Work with all data types, including the built-in types such as int
and double.

<h2 id="sec-6">Choosing a Garbage Collection Algorithm</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
There are three archetypal approaches: reference counting, mark and
sweep, and copying.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-6-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6-1">Reference Counting</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<p>
In reference counting, each dynamically allocated piece of memory has
associated with it a reference count. This count is incremented each
time a reference to the memory is added and decremented each time a
reference to the memory is removed. In C++ terms, this means that each
time a pointer is set to point to a piece of allocated memory, the
reference count associated with that memory is incremented. When the
pointer is set to point elsewhere, the reference count is decremented.
When the reference count drops to zero, the memory is unused and can
be released.
</p>

<p>
The <b>main advantage</b> of reference counting is simplicity—it is easy to
understand and implement. Furthermore, it places no restrictions on
the organization of the heap because the reference count is
independent of an object’s physical location. Reference counting adds
<b>overhead</b> to each pointer operation, but the collection phase is
relatively low cost. The main <b>disadvantage</b> is that circular references
prevent memory that is otherwise unused from being released. A
<b>circular reference</b> occurs when two objects point to each other, either
directly or indirectly. In this situation, neither object’s reference
count ever drops to zero. Some solutions to the circular reference
problem have been devised, but all add complexity and/or overhead.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6-2">Mark and Sweep</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">
<p>
Mark and sweep involves two phases. In the first phase, all objects in
the heap are set to their unmarked state. Then, all objects directly
or indirectly accessible from program variables are marked as
“in-use.” In phase two, all of allocated memory is scanned (that is,
a sweep of memory is made), and all unmarked elements are released.
</p>

<p>
There are two main advantages of mark and sweep. First, it easily
handles circular references. Second, it adds virtually no runtime
overhead prior to collection. It has two main disadvantages. First, a
considerable amount of time might be spent collecting garbage because
the entire heap must be scanned during collection. Thus, garbage
collection may cause unacceptable runtime characteristics for some
programs. Second, although mark and sweep is simple conceptually, it
can be tricky to implement efficiently.
