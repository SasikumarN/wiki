<h1 class="title">A-MPDU &amp; A-MSDU</h1>
<p>
IEEE 802.11 MAC architecture is based on the logical coordination
functions that determine who and when to access the wireless medium at
any time.It supports fragmentation &amp; encryption and act as an
interface between Logical Link Control-LLC sublayer &amp; PHY layer.
</p>


<p>
In legacy 802.11 (prior to 802.11n) standards, there are two type of
access schemes
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>DCF– Distributed Coordination Function (mandatory) based on CSMA/CA.
</li>
<li>PCF– Point Coordination Function (Optional) based on poll-response.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Due to lack of QoS in above implementation 802.11e proposed <b>HCF</b>
(Hybrid Coordination Function) with contention-based channel access
known as <b>EDCA</b> (Enhanced DCF Channel Access). In addition to the
differentiation &amp; prioritization, 802.11e offers <b>TXOP</b> (Tx Opportunity)
an interval of time in which multiple data frames can be transferred
from one station to another as way of improving MAC efficiency. Also
it introduce a way of ACK multiple received data frames known as
“block ACK”.
</p>

<p>
Basic operation of DCF is illustrated below.
</p>

<p><img src="./Files/ampdu-amsdu-01.png" alt="ampdu-amsdu-01.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
After a frame, also known as MAC Service Data Unit (<b>MSDU</b>) arrives from
LLC at the head of the transmission queue, the DCF operation istruct
to MAC to wait <b>DIFS</b> (Distributed Interframe Space) before any other
action. Once frame received by a station check for errors &amp; no errors
are found send ACK after <b>SIFS</b> (Short Interframe Space). If errors
detected or communication disturbed, it will start re-transmission
process.
</p>

<p>
In 802.11n standard, <b>Frame Aggregation</b> was the most important MAC
enhancement proposed which maximize throughput and efficiency. There
are two method available to perform frame aggregation.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Aggregate MAC Service Data Unit (<b>A-MSDU</b>)
</li>
<li>Aggregate MAC Protocol Data Unit (<b>A-MPDU</b>)
</li>
</ol>

<p>
The <b>main distinction</b> between MSDU &amp; MPDU is the former corresponds to
upper part of MAC sublayer where as MPDU.
</p>

<p>
A-MSDU: The concept of A-MSDU is to allow multiple MSDUs to be sent to
the same receiver concatenated in a single MPDU. This supporting
function for A-MSDU within 802.11n is mandatory at the receiver. Due
to Destination Address (DA) and sender Address (SA) in the subframe
header must match to same receiver address (RA) and the transmitter
address (TA) in the MAC header, A-MSDU cannot be used for broadcast &amp;
multicast.
</p>

<p>
A-MPDU: The concept of A-MPDU aggregation is to join Multiple MPDU sub
frames with a single leading PHY header. A key difference from A-MSDU
aggregation is that A-MPDU functions after the MAC header
encapsulation process. This method offer higher MAC throughput compare
to A-MSDU.
</p>


<p>
Below shows these two frame aggregation methods used in 802.11n
protocol standard. (Two level aggregation comprise a blend of A-MPDU &amp;
A-MSDU over two stage also defined,)
