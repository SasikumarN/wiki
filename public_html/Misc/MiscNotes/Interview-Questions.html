n the end, if you are interested in this job, make sure to say so!
Your final question should really nail the closer: “I just want to
let you know that I am very interested in this opportunity, and hope
we can move forward. What are the next steps in the interview
process?” Don’t leave without determining what the expectations are
for the next steps, and how and when YOU should follow-up. Ask what
their timetable is for hiring, and how their hiring process works.

know how to define this it could be good or bad. It could be good
because you could potentially be able to shape the success metrics /
parameters for them or it could be bad if they simply have no idea
how to set you up for success and end up doing it incorrectly.

<h3 id="sec-1-2">NOT to ask and SHOULD ask<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
</div><ul class="org-ul"><li><a id="sec-1-2-1" name="sec-1-2-1"></a>What NOT to ask during an interview:<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Don’t ask what the company does, what products they produce, or
other basic questions that anyone could find the answers to by
simply reading the company’s website. (Do your homework, and don’t
sound like an idiot!)
</li>
<li>Don’t ask about compensation, vacation, or benefits. Those are
clearly things that fall under the category of “what’s in it for
me” — but certainly won’t show what’s in it for the interviewer!
On the other hand, if the interviewer brings up the salary issue
first, be prepared to address it head on.
</li>
<li>Don’t ask about anything sensitive or negative that you might
have read or heard about the company — e.g. recent layoffs, poor
financial performance, bad press reports, lawsuits, complaints or
any other negative issues you are aware of.
</li>
<li>Don’t ask generic, standard questions that sound as though you
found them on a website (like this blog!) and are reciting them
from a script. Most savvy interviewers will be able to spot those
types of canned questions a mile away, and easily distinguish them
from more thoughtful, insightful questions that pertain
specifically to their company or the exact position you are
interviewing for.
</li>
<li>Don’t ask personal questions about the interviewer’s family,
marital status, children, hobbies, political opinions, religious
affiliation, etc. Unless you have a prior history with the person,
issues like that are totally inappropriate for an interview with
someone you just met. (On the other hand, if they bring those things
up first then simply follow their lead … but tread carefully with
these topics and don’t offer up too much personal information of
your own. Try to stay focused on the business at hand.)
</li>
<li>Don’t ask point blank if you are going to get the job. That tends
to put the interviewer on the spot, and makes people feel very
uncomfortable.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li><a id="sec-1-2-2" name="sec-1-2-2"></a>What you SHOULD ask:<br  /><div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ask open-ended questions, as opposed to yes-no questions. “Can you
tell me more about …” “What is your opinion of …” The idea is
to get the interviewer to talk more — to reveal more information
about the company, about the position, about themself and about
their expectations. Ideally, you can then use that information to
say things that will demonstrate that you truly fit whatever it is
they seem to be looking for.
</li>
<li>Take something you learned beforehand about the company, and probe
further. Show that you’ve done your homework about the company. Ask
specific questions about those things that you learned. Start out
with something like “During my research, I read that … I was
wondering …” Demonstrating that you’ve read up on the company,
and that you are curious and interested can be very impressive!
</li>
<li>Take something discussed during the interview, and probe further.
Expand on topics already covered, and ask for more details. This
shows that you’ve been paying attention, and that you are curious,
interested and eager to learn more.
</li>
<li>Ask about the company’s culture and work environment. Those are
issues that tend to be rather abstract, and less likely to be
explained on their website. Therefore, they are good topics to ask
the interviewer about.
</li>
<li>Ask about what qualities they look for in a successful employee. How
can someone succeed and grow within the company? What are the
specific goals and expectations for the position you are
interviewing for? What do they hope to accomplish — both short and
long term — with this hire?

<h2 id="sec-2">Answering the Salary Question<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
“How much did you make at your last job, and what are you looking for
now?” It’s a question that comes up sooner or later in nearly every
job application and/or interview process, and one that can cause panic
and confusion in many job-seekers’ minds. 
</p>

<p>
Or, should you try to dodge that part of the question also, saying
things like: ““I need to know more about the position before I can
answer that question …” “I’m more interested in the job
responsibilities, and not worried so much about numbers at this point
…” “Well, it depends on the total package …”
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-1">Working with 3rd Party Recruiters</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
3rd Party Recruiters represent the needs of the client companies who
pay their fees … but they also represent their candidates and their
needs. If there is a large disconnect between a person’s prior salary
history and the range a company has defined for a particular job, it
is usually a waste of everyone’s time to pursue that match. Sure,
there are exceptions to this – for example, relocation to a place with
a very different cost of living. However, I almost always ask every
candidate I work with exactly what they made at their previous jobs,
and what they need to “make a move” (if they are currently working)
or what they are looking for going forward if they are not currently
working. If a potential candidate dodges that salary history question
or flat out refuses to reveal what their actual income was at their
previous jobs, I would simply explain that I can not represent them
and move on. Matching candidates to job opportunities is a very
complex process — sometimes more of an art than a science. However,
certain nuts and bolts information about a candidate (specific skills,
years of experience, and yes, salary history) are critical to know at
the beginning of that matching process. If someone doesn’t trust
their recruiter with such basic information, there would be no basis
for a working relationship. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Working with HR Professionals or Company Recruiters</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
If directly asked what your prior salary history was by a company
representative – I say answer the question! Don’t ever lie or
exaggerate. (The truth will always come back to bite you!) If the
question is part of an online application, you sometimes have the
choice of leaving those fields blank (or putting “$1.00,” saying
“Negotiable,”  etc.) That might work sometimes … but may also be a
reason for whoever reviews your application to simply pass on you
without ever telling you why. I know … you don’t want your history
to “pigeon-hole” you into a low number that is below what you want
or need. But there is a risk associated with either way of dealing
with it. The bottom line is the same as the answer to #1 above: If
there is a large disconnect between a person’s prior salary history
and the range a company has defined for a particular job, it is
usually a waste of everyone’s time to pursue that match. Sooner or
later, you’ll have to reveal your salary history – it’s inevitable.
If that information ends up being perceived as a red flag for the
company, they’ll want to know up front … not after spending a lot of
time with you on phone or inviting you in for face-to-face interviews.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-3">“What salary are you looking for?”</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
This is probably the toughest question to deal with. Again, I say
answer the question! However, give a range – a span anywhere between a
$5 and 15K spread is typical – rather than a specific number. It
always helps if you know the range that the company has defined for
the job you are applying to. Whenever possible, try to get that
information beforehand. Barring that, use your common sense, do some
research, and try to guess the range based on industry knowledge. The
bottom line is: you should know in your mind what number is at the
bottom of your acceptable range – the number below which you wouldn’t
even consider accepting a job. It’s what you need to pay your bills.
The bottom of your stated range should never be below that number. It
could be a bit higher, but should also jive with your salary history.
(If you are currently working, that low number would logically be
slightly higher than your current salary — but not so much higher that
you seem greedy. Most potential new employers would expect you to
prove yourself before they’ll just hand you a “raise” from day
one!) Don’t assume that the lower number you give is the one they’ll
focus on and offer you. Most companies will want to pay people
somewhere in the middle of both your and their range, and won’t
simply low-ball you if they truly want you. If your “middle” and
their “middle” overlap, then you’ve hit their sweet spot!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2-4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-4">summarize</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
So, to summarize: I say do not avoid the salary questions. Answer them
directly and with as much confidence as you can. You can’t escape
from or expect to hide your own salary history. HR people and
recruiters will have much more respect for you, and be more willing to
engage with you, if you are simply honest with them. Just be prepared
to discuss it intelligently, and armed with the best company and
industry information you can. If there are extenuating circumstances
that explain either why you’ve been underpaid in the past and now
desire more, or conversely why you are now willing to take a cut in
pay, be prepared to articulate those issues as well.
